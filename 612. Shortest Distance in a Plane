Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
 

| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
 

The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
 

| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
 

Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.



# Write your MySQL query statement below
select min(round(sqrt((a.x-b.x)*(a.x-b.x)+(a.y-b.y)*(a.y-b.y)),2)) as shortest
from point_2d a,point_2d b 
where a.x!=b.x or a.y!=b.y
